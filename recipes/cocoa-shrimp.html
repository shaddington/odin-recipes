<h1>Cocoa Shrimp</h1>
<img src="/cocoa-shrimp.webp">
    <h2>These saucy shrimp borrow from the earthy, spicy flavors of a Mexican mole to create a one-pan recipe that comes together in just 30 minutes. To mimic the complex flavor of a slow-cooked sauce, tomato paste gets caramelized with cocoa powder, smoked paprika, chili powder, and cayenne, creating a smoky, savory base. Throwing the shrimp directly into the sauce in lieu of searing first not only makes things easier but means they get cooked gently, ensuring a perfectly tender texture. Served with tostadas, cilantro, and lime wedges, this dish makes a flavorful weeknight dinner.</h2>

    <h2>Preparation</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Step 1

                Heat 3 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil in a large skillet over medium. Cook 1 medium onion, finely chopped, and 4 garlic cloves, finely grated, stirring often, until onion is softened and fragrant, about 4 minutes. Add ⅓ cup double-concentrated tomato paste, 2 Tbsp. chili powder, 1 Tbsp. unsweetened cocoa powder, 2 tsp. smoked paprika, and ½ tsp. cayenne pepper and cook, stirring constantly, until paste starts to stick to bottom of pan, about 2 minutes. Stir in 2 tsp. all-purpose flour, then gradually pour in 1¾ cups low-sodium vegetable broth, whisking constantly. Bring mixture to a simmer.</li>
            <li>Step 2

                Add juice of 1 medium lime, 2 Tbsp. dark brown sugar, and 1½ tsp. Diamond Crystal or 1 tsp. Morton kosher salt and stir until sugar and salt are dissolved. Add 1½ lb. large shrimp, peeled, deveined, and cook, stirring constantly, until just opaque and slightly curled, about 5 minutes. Taste shrimp mixture and season with more salt if needed. Remove from heat.</li>
            <li>Step 3

                Top shrimp mixture with cilantro leaves and serve with tostadas and lime wedges for squeezing over if desired.</li>

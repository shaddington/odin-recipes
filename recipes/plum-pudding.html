<h1>Baked Plum Pudding</h1>

    <h2>Feel free to use your favorite kind of plum for this pudding recipe, but we recommend prune plums, which have an almond-shaped body that tapers at the end. They’re on the smaller side, hold up well, and the pit comes off the flesh easily, all of which makes them especially good for baking.</h2>
